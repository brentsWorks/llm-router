# LLM Router - Technical Design Document

## Overview

A complete full-stack web application that provides intelligent LLM routing as a service. The application automatically selects the optimal language model for each task and executes prompts through OpenRouter's unified API, providing real-time LLM responses with intelligent model selection.

**Business Model**: Production-ready web application with OpenRouter integration
**Development Approach**: Test-Driven Development (TDD) with Red-Green-Refactor cycles
**Current Status**: **PROJECT COMPLETE** - Full-stack application with React frontend and FastAPI backend

## Architecture

### Complete Full-Stack Architecture
```
Frontend: User Interface → Prompt Input → Routing Request → Model Selection Display → Real LLM Response
Backend: Route Request → Hybrid Classification → Model Selection → OpenRouter API → LLM Response
```

### Production Architecture
```
React Frontend → FastAPI Backend → OpenRouter API → Real LLM Models → Response Streaming
```

## Production Architecture

### Frontend Application (React + TypeScript)
```typescript
// Complete React application with three-tab interface
interface AppState {
  currentTab: 'router' | 'models' | 'about';
  preferences: RoutingPreferences;
  routingResults: RouteResponse | null;
  executionResults: ExecuteResponse | null;
}

// Router component with real-time routing
const Router = ({ preferences, onPreferencesChange }) => {
  const handlePromptSubmit = async (prompt: string) => {
    const results = await apiService.routePrompt({ prompt, preferences });
    setRoutingResults(results);
  };
  
  const handleExecute = async () => {
    const results = await apiService.executePrompt({ prompt, preferences });
    setExecutionResults(results);
  };
};
```

### Backend Services (FastAPI + Python)
```python
# Complete FastAPI backend with OpenRouter integration
@app.post("/route")
async def route_prompt(request: RouteRequest):
    # Hybrid classification (RAG + LLM fallback)
    classification = await classifier.classify(request.prompt)
    
    # Model selection with scoring and constraints
    candidates = await scoring_engine.score_models(classification, request.preferences)
    selected_model = await ranker.rank_models(candidates, request.constraints)
    
    return RouteResponse(selected_model=selected_model, classification=classification)

@app.post("/execute")
async def execute_prompt(request: ExecuteRequest):
    # Real LLM execution through OpenRouter
    response = await openrouter_service.execute(
        model=request.model,
        prompt=request.prompt,
        preferences=request.preferences
    )
    return ExecuteResponse(llm_response=response)

3. **Behavior-Driven**: Tests describe business value and expected behaviors
4. **Fast Feedback**: Tests must be fast and reliable for continuous development
