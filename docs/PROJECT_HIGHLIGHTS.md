    embedding: List[float]
    reasoning: Optional[str]  # LLM-provided explanation
    
    def __post_init__(self):
        assert 0.0 <= self.confidence <= 1.0

    @model_validator(mode="after")
    def validate_ranking_data_consistency(self) -> "RankingResult":
        # Ensures data consistency between models and scores

### **Testing Standards**
```python
def test_should_[expected_behavior]_when_[condition]():
    # Arrange - Set up test data
    # Act - Execute the code being tested
    # Assert - Verify expected outcomes
```

### **Code Quality Automation**
