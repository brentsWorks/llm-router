## 🚀 The Problem

In today's AI landscape, choosing the right language model is increasingly complex:

### The "One Size Fits All" Dilemma
- **GPT-4** is powerful but expensive for simple tasks like summarization
- **GPT-3.5** is cost-effective but may lack quality for complex reasoning
- **Claude-3-Haiku** is fast but might not handle specialized coding tasks well
- **Specialized models** excel in specific domains but require manual selection

### Current Challenges
- 🔥 **Over-spending**: Using premium models for tasks that cheaper models handle well
- ⏱️ **Sub-optimal latency**: Using slow models when fast ones would suffice  
- 📉 **Quality inconsistency**: Manual model selection leads to poor task-model matching
- 🧠 **Decision fatigue**: Developers shouldn't need to be model experts for every task
- 📈 **Scale complexity**: Managing model selection across hundreds of use cases

> "I spend more time deciding which model to use than actually building features" - Common developer sentiment

## 💡 Our Solution

**LLM Router** automatically selects the optimal model for each task using a sophisticated hybrid approach:

### 🔍 Semantic-First Intelligence
- **Instant Classification**: Analyzes prompt content using embeddings
- **Context Understanding**: Identifies task type (code, creative, Q&A, summarization)
- **Pattern Recognition**: Learns from examples to improve accuracy over time
- **Lightning Fast**: Sub-100ms routing decisions

### 🧠 LLM-Assisted Fallback
- **Edge Case Handling**: When semantic confidence is low, uses LLM analysis
- **Nuanced Understanding**: Handles ambiguous or complex prompt types
- **Confidence-Based**: Only activates when needed to maintain speed

### ⚡ Smart Optimization Engine
- **Multi-Factor Scoring**: Balances cost, latency, and quality with configurable weights
- **Constraint Handling**: Respects context length, safety, and availability requirements
- **Provider Agnostic**: Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, and other providers

## 🎯 Key Benefits

### 💰 **Cost Optimization**
- **20-30% cost reduction** by using cheaper models for suitable tasks
- **Automatic scaling** from development to production budgets
- **Transparent pricing** with real-time cost tracking

### ⚡ **Performance Enhancement**
- **Faster responses** by routing to low-latency models when appropriate
- **Quality maintenance** by ensuring task-model compatibility
- **Reduced decision overhead** - focus on building, not model selection

### 🛡️ **Production Ready**
- **High availability** with fallback chains and circuit breakers
- **Comprehensive monitoring** with metrics and observability
- **Type-safe configuration** with environment-based settings

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
pip install llm-router
```

### Basic Usage
```python
from llm_router import Router, get_config

# Initialize router with your preferences
router = Router()

# Route a prompt to the optimal model
decision = router.route(
    prompt="Write a Python function to calculate fibonacci numbers",
    preferences={
        "cost_weight": 0.3,
        "latency_weight": 0.4,
        "quality_weight": 0.3
    }
)

print(f"Selected: {decision.selected_model.provider}/{decision.selected_model.model}")
print(f"Estimated cost: ${decision.selected_model.estimated_cost:.4f}")
print(f"Confidence: {decision.confidence:.2%}")
```
