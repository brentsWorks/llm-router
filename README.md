## 🚀 The Problem

In today's AI landscape, choosing the right language model is increasingly complex:

### The "One Size Fits All" Dilemma
- **GPT-4** is powerful but expensive for simple tasks like summarization
- **GPT-3.5** is cost-effective but may lack quality for complex reasoning
- **Claude-3-Haiku** is fast but might not handle specialized coding tasks well
- **Specialized models** excel in specific domains but require manual selection

### Current Challenges
- 🔥 **Over-spending**: Using premium models for tasks that cheaper models handle well
- ⏱️ **Sub-optimal latency**: Using slow models when fast ones would suffice  
- 📉 **Quality inconsistency**: Manual model selection leads to poor task-model matching
- 🧠 **Decision fatigue**: Developers shouldn't need to be model experts for every task
- 📈 **Scale complexity**: Managing model selection across hundreds of use cases

> "I want to focus on building features, not becoming an expert on which LLM to use for each task" - Every developer using multiple AI providers
