## 🚀 The Problem

In today's AI landscape, choosing the right language model is increasingly complex:

### The "One Size Fits All" Dilemma
- **GPT-4** is powerful but expensive for simple tasks like summarization
- **GPT-3.5** is cost-effective but may lack quality for complex reasoning
- **Claude-3-Haiku** is fast but might not handle specialized coding tasks well
- **Specialized models** excel in specific domains but require manual selection

### Current Challenges
- 🔥 **Over-spending**: Using premium models for tasks that cheaper models handle well
- ⏱️ **Sub-optimal latency**: Using slow models when fast ones would suffice  
- 📉 **Quality inconsistency**: Manual model selection leads to poor task-model matching
- 🧠 **Decision fatigue**: Developers shouldn't need to be model experts for every task
- 📈 **Scale complexity**: Managing model selection across hundreds of use cases

> "I want to focus on building features, not becoming an expert on which LLM to use for each task" - Every developer using multiple AI providers

## 💡 Our Solution

**LLM Router** automatically selects the optimal model for each task and executes your prompts:

### 🔍 Intelligent Model Selection
- **Semantic Analysis**: Understands your prompt content and intent automatically
- **Cost Optimization**: Routes to cheaper models when quality won't suffer
- **Performance Matching**: Selects fast models for simple tasks, powerful ones for complex work
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensures task-model compatibility for best results

### 🧠 Hybrid Classification
- **Rule-Based Speed**: Instant routing for common patterns (code, creative, Q&A)
- **ML-Enhanced Accuracy**: Vector embeddings for nuanced prompt understanding (planned)
- **LLM Fallback**: Uses AI for edge cases when confidence is low (planned)
- **Dynamic Learning**: Improves routing decisions based on results

### ⚡ Simple Integration
- **Easy Setup**: Configure with your own API keys from providers
- **Automatic Execution**: Returns actual LLM responses, not just model selection
- **Graceful Degradation**: Handles rate limits and API failures elegantly
- **Multiple Providers**: Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, and more

# Custom routing preferences
result = router.route_and_execute(
    prompt="Write a creative story about AI",
    preferences={
        "cost_weight": 0.5,      # Prioritize cost savings
        "latency_weight": 0.3,   # Some latency tolerance

    },
    constraints={
        "max_cost_per_1k_tokens": 0.01,  # Budget constraint
        "max_latency_ms": 2000           # Speed requirement
